Starting on April 27, our projections are generated from the previous day's data. For example, April 26 Reich forecasts are generated from April 26 data, but April 27 Reich forecasts are generated from April 26 data, April 28 forecasts from April 27 data, etc.

Starting on May 2, we provided 1-50 days ahead forecasts and 1-10 weeks ahead forecasts. Previously, we provided 1-7 days ahead forecasts and 1-6 weeks ahead forecasts.

Starting on July 4, we no longer included 1-50 days ahead forecasts.
